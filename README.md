# NLP Project: Sentence Embeddings, Similarity, Clustering, and Title Generation

This project explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and manipulate text data. It focuses on:

* **Sentence Embeddings:** Generating meaningful vector representations of sentences.
* **Similarity Calculation:**  Using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) and cosine similarity to efficiently calculate similarity between sentence embeddings.
* **Clustering:** Applying different clustering algorithms to group similar sentences together.
* **Title Generation:** Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically generate titles for given text.

## Key Features

* **Efficient Similarity Search:** FAISS is used to perform fast and scalable similarity search on a large number of sentence embeddings.
* **Multiple Clustering Algorithms:** The project explores various clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) to identify different patterns in the data.
* **Automatic Title Generation:** An LLM is employed to generate concise and relevant titles for input text, aiding in summarization and information retrieval.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language for the project.
* **NLP Libraries:** Libraries like Transformers, SentenceTransformers, or spaCy for sentence embedding generation.
* **FAISS:**  For efficient similarity search and clustering.
* **Clustering Libraries:** scikit-learn for implementing clustering algorithms.
* **LLM API/Library:**  A library or API for accessing and utilizing a Large Language Model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, Hugging Face Transformers).
