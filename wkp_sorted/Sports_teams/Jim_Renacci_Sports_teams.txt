== 2018 election campaigns ==


=== Gubernatorial ===

In January 2017, several news outlets reported that Renacci was considering running for Governor of Ohio in 2018. Politico reported that "as a wealthy auto dealer prior to being elected to Congress, Renacci would potentially be able to self-fund a statewide bid." On March 21, 2017, Renacci announced his intention to run for the Republican nomination for governor of Ohio in 2018. He dropped out of the governor's race in January 2018 in order to run for U.S. Senate.

In January 2018, Renacci announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate. On May 8, 2018, he won the Republican primary, becoming the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate from Ohio. In his campaign, Renacci was endorsed by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence.In 2018, he was ranked Ohio's wealthiest Congress member.  In 2018, he was endorsed by Donald Trump in his race for Brown's seat in Senate. During debates with Sherrod Brown, a debate at WOSU-TV studios in Columbus was almost cancelled after "last-minute arguing between the two sides, fueled by Renacci's recent escalation of personal attacks against Brown."In March 2018, the Associated Press reported that as a registered lobbyist, Renacci had failed to report $50,000 in political contributions he had been given from 2008 to 2010. Renacci's campaign, in response, said he never lobbied, and had only been registered as a lobbyist with a consulting firm, Smokerise International Group, he helped found in 2008 as a "precautionary measure." Although Renacci's lawyer provided paperwork to journalists showing he had been listed as "inactive" as a lobbyist in 2009, the Associated Press found Renacci's lobbyist registration was deactivated in May 2011, the year when the paperwork was filed, and four months after he entered Congress.In October 2018, he defended flying on the plane of a strip club owner to meet with religious figures, staying "He's a volunteer who... I met during the campaign. He asked to volunteer for me. I'm not going to vet volunteers, and I'm not going to vet the press's looking at volunteers." At the time, press and Ohio Republicans noted that since the May primary, Renacci had spent half a million on advertising, while Brown had spent $12.5 million, and "some Ohio Republicans have questioned whether Renacci's lack of advertising reflects his unwillingness to spend his own money on his race. Renacci has loaned his campaign $4 million of his own money, which represent[ed] the majority of his campaign fundraising."Renacci was defeated by incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown in the November 6, 2018, general election. Brown received 53% of the vote, while Renacci received 47%.

== 2022 Ohio gubernatorial campaign ==

Renacci wrote a number of op-eds criticizing Ohio governor Mike DeWine.  May 2021, NBC News reported that Brad Parscale was offering unpaid support to Renacci in considering a gubernatorial bid.  a tweet criticizing Governor Mike DeWine in June 2021, WKYC hinted Renacci might enter the race for governor in 2022. He launched a primary campaign officially later on June 9, 2021. He stated in an interview, "Ohio cannot afford for Mike DeWine to be the governor anymore. My path may have been diverted in 2018 but my will really to change Ohio was not." He said he wouldn't have hired Amy Acton, Ohio Department of Health director, saying her announcement of early predictions about COVID-19 had been a "scare tactic. That scared people." With his gubernatorial bid advised by Brad Parscale, Renacci also stated "Trump is still a friend. I think in the end if I get an opportunity to talk with him, which I'm hoping to be able to do that, he'll see that Jim Renacci has a really good opportunity." Although he had stated his support for Trump, by June 22, 2021, Trump hadn't endorsed a candidate in the Ohio Senate or gubernatorial races. Alongside Parscale, Renacci brought in "numerous" other former Trump staffers to his campaign, according to The Gazette.

The court's opinion stated that the Ohio tax commissioner had abused his discretion by penalizing the Renaccis because the couple had reasonably believed they did not owe taxes on profits from an entity that the state later determined was subject to taxation. The Renaccis had relied on an earlier legal interpretation in delaying tax payments.
